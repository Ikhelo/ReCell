# ReCell Project

# Background
According the International Data Corporation (IDC) used smartphone (including officially refurbished) shipments amounted to 206.7 million units. In a more recent report, Mordor Intelligence valued the used and refurbished smartphone market at 251.09 million units in 2021 and forecasts that the growth to reach 459.86 million by 2027. That is, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) 10.32%. This upward trend in the demand for used smartphones and devices maybe due to the dismantling of the stigma surrounding the purchase of pre-owned smartphones and devices.

The regularity of multiple product launches has also led to an increase in the supply stream for used smartphones and devices thereby increasing the used smartphones stock. Nowadays, most smartphones are supported with software updates for years after their initial launch further incentivising buyers to opt for used smartphones at cheaper prices. Refurbished and used smartphones have become easy to acquire on popular e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Ebay, Alibaba and Aliexpress. Buyers can easily shop around for the best deals before making purchases. The COVID-19 pandemic also exacerbated the demand for used smartphones and devices. As people had less disposable income, it became essential to revise their expenses.

Apart from the benefit to the buyers, the issue of e-waste can finally be addressed. This is a huge benefit to the environment. As consumers settle for used or refurbished phones, the rate of e-waste generation can be slowed down to a controllable level.

# Objective
Recell is a startup that plans to develop a dynamic pricing system that can predict the prices of used and refurbished smartphones and devices based on some independent variables by using machine learning to understand the relationship between the predictors and price, and build a linear regression model with the most significant predictors which are able to influence the price of used and refurbished smartphones.
